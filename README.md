# Self-Refine-Reimplementation
CMU Advanced NLP - Assignment 3

##Abstract
In this assignment, our primary focus was on surveying language models specifically used for code generation problems and exploring methods to provide feedback to the model to improve upon its previous generations. After conducting a literature survey, we found that the paper "SELF-REFINE: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback" is the closest to what we are trying to implement in Assignment 4. We have re-implemented the code optimization part in this paper.

##Setup
